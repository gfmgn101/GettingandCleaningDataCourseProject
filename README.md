# GettingandCleaningDataCourseProject README

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to submit the Week 4 [assignment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project) of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course in the Coursera class on Data Science.

## Data background
Per the assignment, "the data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone." There are two main sets of data - a training set and a test set. Each set contains accelerometer measurements for a variety of metrics for thirty (30) subjects doing six different physical activities:
* Walking
* Walking upstairs
* Walking downstairs
* Sitting
* Standing
* Laying

The metrics include but are not limited to acceleration of the body, by gravity in each of the three X, Y, Z dimensions, rotational acceleration, and jerk movements analyzed over time and using a fourier transform method.
